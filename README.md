<h1>Console Rock Paper Scissors Game</h1>
<p>
    This project is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors console game made with javascript. I used the Math class to apply the random method, and the string class to apply the toLowerCase method.

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>
    With this project I applied the things that I learned about problem solving and JavaScrpit. There isn't a lot more 
    to say, because my experience with other languages translated with what I applied in this project.
